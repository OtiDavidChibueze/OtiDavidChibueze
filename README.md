# HI 👋, I'M DAVID CHIBUEZE
### Mobile Developer | Full-Stack Engineer | Flutter & Node.js Specialist
I’m a passionate and results-driven Flutter Developer with 5+ years of experience creating sleek, high-performance cross-platform mobile applications and building scalable backend systems. I combine beautiful front-end experiences with solid back-end logic to deliver complete, production-ready products.

📱 Mobile Development with Flutter & Dart
I specialize in building modern and responsive mobile apps using Flutter and Dart. I follow clean architecture and apply Bloc, Cubit, or Provider for effective state management. From UI design to backend integration, I deliver apps that are smooth, reliable, and user-friendly.

🎨 Frontend Mobile Skills (UI/UX)
I'm passionate about crafting visually stunning and responsive interfaces that enhance user experience and keep users engaged. I bring ideas to life using:

Custom UI/UX design in Flutter

Responsive layouts across screen sizes

Widget composition & animation

Navigation & routing

Form validation & input handling

Theming, dark mode, and adaptive design

Smooth transitions and animations (using Hero, AnimatedContainer, Lottie, etc.)

Whether it's building dashboards, onboarding flows, or fully interactive components—I pay close attention to every pixel and every user interaction.

🛠️ Backend Engineering
I build secure and scalable backend systems using:

Node.js, Express, TypeScript

Authentication (JWT)

MongoDB for data management

Stripe for payment integration

REST API design & 3rd-party integrations

My backend work is optimized to support mobile apps with reliable data and fast performance.

🤝 Collaboration & Problem Solving
I work well with cross-functional teams in agile environments. Whether collaborating with designers, backend developers, or project managers—I communicate clearly, solve challenges fast, and deliver features on time.

📚 Growth & Learning
I’m committed to continuous learning and improvement. I stay updated with the latest Flutter updates, experiment with new packages, and apply industry best practices in every project I touch.
